Java data types are broadly **divided into two categories**:

- **Primitive Data Types**
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**

## **Primitive Data Types**

There are **eight primitive data types** in Java:

| Data Type | Size         | Description                                                |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| byte      | 1 byte (8 bits)  | Whole numbers from -128 to 127; memory-efficient in     arrays     |
| short     | 2 bytes (16 bits)| Whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767                          |
| int       | 4 bytes (32 bits)| Whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647            |
| long      | 8 bytes (64 bits)| Whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float     | 4 bytes (32 bits)| Fractional numbers; single-precision floating point            |
| double    | 8 bytes (64 bits)| Fractional numbers; double-precision floating point (more precise than float) |
| boolean   | 1 bit (size JVM dependent)| Only possible values: `true` or `false`                  |
| char      | 2 bytes (16 bits)| Single Unicode character (from 0 to 65,535)                   |

## **Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference/Object Types)**

Examples:
- **String**
- **Arrays**
- **Classes**
- **Interfaces**
- **Objects**

These are more complex than primitives and store references to memory locations where the data is actually stored.

**Summary:**
- **Primitive types** are predefined and handle simple values directly.
- **Non-primitive types** are reference types that can be used to create more complex data structures and objects.
